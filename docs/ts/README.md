TS code for the client side of the cooking blog generated by Jekyll.  
This TS code is supposed to be transpiled to JS in the `js/` directory of the blog. Jekyll should then pull it and integrate it to the `_site` directory together with the generated site.  

## Development setup

Contrary to other node.js setups, we don't need node's HTTP server to serve the site. We only use node to build the site. The development server is managed by jekyll.  
So from this directory, just run `npm run build_dev`. (this is just a node script that wraps `tsc -w`). This command will watch and compile when a change is made to a TS file. If in parallel you run the `bundle exec jekyll server` command that also watches for changes in the jekyll site srcs, you shoul be able to see the results of your changes in real time on your local server.
