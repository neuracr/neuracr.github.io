The most balanced dessert in taste !
You'll need a specific ustensil: <b>cake pan with a removable bottom</b>.


<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="recipe-instructions">
  
  The bottom cookie 🍪:
  <ol>
    <li>Crunch the Speculoos (in freezer bag for instance) and mixed it with melted butter</li>
    <li>Put baking paper at the bottom of the cake pan with removable bottom and butter the side</li>
    <li>Spread the mixture on the bottom of the cake pan and smooth off the surface</li>
  </ol>

  The cream in between 🧀:
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Soak 4 gelatin leaves in cold water for 5 min. Keep some of the fresh cream to soak the last leaf of gelatin later</li>
    <li>In a container mix the rest of the fresh cream, the ricotta and all of the sugar</li>
    <li>In a pot heat the fresh cream and dissolve the 4 gelatin leaves. Add the mixture with the cream and ricotta. Mix thoroughly</li>
    <li>Spread over the cookie and put it in the fridge for 2 hours before adding the raspberry topping</li>
  </ol>
    
  The raspberry topping 🍓:
  
  <ol start="8">
    <li>Soak the last gelatin leaf in cold water</li>
    <li>Heat the raspberries in a pot for 10 min. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and heat it for another 1 min. Add water if necessary</li>
    <li>Add the gelatin to the raspberries and mix it</li>
    <li>Pour the topping over the cake and sway the cake pan to spread over the whole surface</li>
  </ol>

  End of preparation 😋 :

  <ol start="12">
    <li>Put it in the fridge at least 2 hours (the best is to wait until the next day). The more you wait, the better it gets !</li>
    <li>Before tasting remove the cake pan and the baking paper. Now you can serve and enjoy !</li>
  </ol>
