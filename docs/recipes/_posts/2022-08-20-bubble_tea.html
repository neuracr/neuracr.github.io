<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot boil the first volume of water</li>
        <li>In a kettle boil the second volume of water</li>
        <li>In a jug pour 4/5 of the second volume (75cL with default values). Infuse the tea bags for 7 min.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling in the pot, put in the bobas and boil them for 30min (the time depends on the bobas you have)</li>
        <li>In a bowl pour the 1/5 of hot water remaining, add the honey and the sugar and stir until complete dissolution</li>
        <li>Once the tea infused remove the bags and add the milk. To make the tea cool faster you can make a cold bain-marie in your sink.</li>
        <li>Once the bobas boiled remove the pot from the heat and wait for 20min. Put the jug and the bowl in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once the bobas cooled sieve the bobas with cold water and then put them in the bowl with sugar and honey and wait for 5min.</li>
        <li>In a glass or a cup pour the tea (3/4 of your cup), add the bobas with as much sugar as you want and add 3 ice cubes.</li>
