<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the first volume of water (1L) in a pot</li>

        <li>Boil the second volume of water in a kettle</li>

        <li>Pour 4/5 of the second volume (75cL with default values) in a jug. Infuse the tea bags for 7 min.</li>

        <li>Once the water is boiling in the pot, put the bobas in and boil them for 30min (the time depends on the bobas you have)</li>

        <li>Pour the 1/5 of remaining hot water in a bowl, add the honey and the sugar and stir until complete dissolution</li>

        <li>Once the tea infused remove the bags and add the milk. To make the tea cool faster you can make a cold bain-marie in your sink.</li>
        <li>Once the bobas boiled remove the pot from the heat and wait for 20min. Put the jug and the bowl in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once the bobas have cooled down, sieve the bobas and rinse them with cold water. Then put them in the bowl with sugar and honey and wait for 5min.</li>

        <li>Pour the tea (3/4 of your cup) in a glass or a cup and add the bobas with as much sugar as you want and add 3 ice cubes.</li>
